<objective>
Create the complete plugin directory structure with valid plugin.json manifest and SKILL.md file containing all required Agent Skills spec frontmatter fields.

Purpose: Establish the foundational file structure that Claude Code can recognize and load as a valid plugin, with compliant skill metadata that enables auto-activation.

Output: Working plugin structure with plugin.json, SKILL.md with full frontmatter, and optional directories for progressive disclosure.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create plugin directory structure and manifest</name>
  <files>.claude-plugin/plugin.json</files>
  <action>
Create the .claude-plugin/ directory at the plugin root and add a valid plugin.json manifest.

The plugin.json must contain:
- "name": "stacks-skills" (lowercase, hyphens only)
- "description": "Claude Code plugin for Stacks blockchain development with enforced TDD workflow"
- "version": "0.1.0"
- "author": { "name": "Stacks Skills Contributors" }
- "license": "Apache-2.0"

CRITICAL: The .claude-plugin/ directory should ONLY contain plugin.json. Do NOT put skills/, agents/, or hooks/ inside .claude-plugin/.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `jq . .claude-plugin/plugin.json`
Must output valid JSON with all required fields.
  </verify>
  <done>
plugin.json exists at .claude-plugin/plugin.json with valid JSON containing name, description, version, author, and license fields.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create SKILL.md with complete frontmatter</name>
  <files>skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Create the skills/stacks-dev/ directory and SKILL.md file with complete YAML frontmatter.

Required frontmatter fields:
- name: stacks-dev (MUST match directory name exactly, lowercase + hyphens only)
- description: Multi-sentence description including trigger keywords (Stacks, Clarity, Clarinet, smart contracts) and "Use when..." clause. Keep under 500 characters.
- license: Apache-2.0
- metadata:
    author: "Stacks Skills Contributors"
    version: "0.1.0"
- allowed-tools: Read Write Edit Bash Grep Glob

Description should be:
"Stacks blockchain development assistant. Guides Clarity smart contract development using test-driven development with Clarinet CLI. Use when working with Stacks, Clarity smart contracts, Clarinet projects, or when building applications on the Stacks blockchain."

After the frontmatter, add a minimal skill body (placeholder for Phase 2):
- Title: "# Stacks Development Assistant"
- Brief intro paragraph explaining the skill's purpose
- "## Workflow" section with high-level phases: Design, Test, Implement, Verify, Deploy, Integrate
- "## Additional Resources" section noting that references/ will contain detailed docs
- Keep under 100 lines total for now (will be expanded in Phase 2)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Check frontmatter: `head -20 skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md` should show YAML block with all fields
2. Check line count: `wc -l skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md` should be under 100 lines
3. Check name matches directory: The `name` field value must equal the directory name "stacks-dev"
  </verify>
  <done>
SKILL.md exists at skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md with valid YAML frontmatter containing all 5 required fields (name, description, license, metadata, allowed-tools) and a placeholder skill body under 100 lines.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create optional directories for progressive disclosure</name>
  <files>
skills/stacks-dev/references/.gitkeep
skills/stacks-dev/scripts/.gitkeep
skills/stacks-dev/assets/.gitkeep
  </files>
  <action>
Create the three optional directories inside skills/stacks-dev/ as specified by SPEC-08:

1. references/ - For on-demand documentation files (clarity-patterns.md, testing-guide.md, etc.)
2. scripts/ - For executable scripts (validation scripts, setup scripts)
3. assets/ - For templates and static files (contract templates, config examples)

Add .gitkeep file to each directory to ensure git tracks empty directories.

These directories will be populated in Phase 2 (Core Skill Structure).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `ls -la skills/stacks-dev/`
Must show: SKILL.md, references/, scripts/, assets/
  </verify>
  <done>
Three optional directories exist (references/, scripts/, assets/) with .gitkeep files, ready for progressive disclosure content in Phase 2.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After all tasks complete:

1. Directory structure check:
```bash
find . -type f -name "*.json" -o -name "*.md" -o -name ".gitkeep" | grep -v ".git/" | grep -v ".planning/" | sort
```
Should show:
- .claude-plugin/plugin.json
- skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md
- skills/stacks-dev/references/.gitkeep
- skills/stacks-dev/scripts/.gitkeep
- skills/stacks-dev/assets/.gitkeep

2. plugin.json validation:
```bash
jq . .claude-plugin/plugin.json
```
Must be valid JSON with name, description, version.

3. SKILL.md frontmatter check:
```bash
head -15 skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md
```
Must show YAML block with name, description, license, metadata, allowed-tools.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- plugin.json exists and is valid JSON with all required fields
- SKILL.md exists with complete YAML frontmatter (5 required fields)
- Skill name "stacks-dev" matches directory name exactly
- Optional directories (references/, scripts/, assets/) exist
- Total file count: 5 files created
- Ready for validation in Plan 02
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-plugin-foundation-compliance/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
