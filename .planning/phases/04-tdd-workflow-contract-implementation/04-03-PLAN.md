<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update Phase 2 (Tests) with collaborative test workflow</name>
  <files>skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Update Phase 2/5: Tests section in SKILL.md:

1. Add new subsection "### Collaborative Test Generation" before Steps:
```markdown
### Collaborative Test Generation

I'll propose test scenarios organized by category:

**Happy Path:**
- [Scenario description with expected outcome]

**Edge Cases:**
- [Zero/boundary values, empty inputs]

**Error Handling:**
- [Authorization failures, validation errors]

Review and approve the scenarios. After approval, I'll write all test code in batch.
```

2. Update Steps section to reflect collaborative workflow:
- Step 1: Create contract scaffold (unchanged)
- Step 2: I propose test scenarios based on design doc
- Step 3: You review and approve scenarios
- Step 4: I write test files implementing approved scenarios
- Step 5: Run tests (should fail - RED phase)

3. Add soft TDD enforcement note:
```markdown
### TDD Compliance

If you request contract code before tests exist, I'll gently redirect:
"Following TDD, let's write tests first. This helps catch edge cases early."

If you prefer to proceed anyway, I'll continue and track the workflow:
- **TDD: ✓ followed** - Tests written before implementation
- **TDD: ⚠ skipped** - Contract written before tests (increased coverage threshold)
```

4. Update verification checklist to include scenario approval:
- [ ] Test scenarios proposed and approved
- [ ] Test file exists for each contract
- [ ] All public functions have at least one test
- [ ] `clarinet check` passes
- [ ] Tests fail as expected (RED phase)

5. Update reference link to enhanced clarity-tdd.md

Phase 2 updated:

grep "TDD Compliance" skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md
grep "TDD:.*followed" skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md

Phase 2 includes collaborative test generation workflow, soft TDD enforcement, and updated verification checklist.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update Phase 3 (Implementation) with best practices review</name>
  <files>skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Update Phase 3/5: Implementation section in SKILL.md:

1. Add new subsection "### Best Practices Review" after Steps:
```markdown
### Best Practices Review

After each function, I'll review for Clarity best practices:

**Coding Style:**
- Sequential asserts instead of nested if
- Meaningful error codes (HTTP-like: 400, 401, 404)
- No unnecessary begin blocks
- No unwrap-panic (use unwrap! with error codes)

**Storage:**
- Hash storage for large data
- Minimal on-chain storage
- Efficient map usage

**Upgradability:**
- Dynamic principals for upgradable references
- Data/logic separation where appropriate

I'll auto-fix mechanical violations (unnecessary begin, unwrap-panic) and explain what changed.
For structural changes (nested if → asserts), I'll ask first.
```

2. Add `clarinet check` automation note:
```markdown
### Automatic Validation

After every contract modification, I run `clarinet check` to catch:
- Syntax errors
- Type mismatches
- Undefined references
```

3. Add reference link to new clarity-implementation.md:
```markdown
**Reference:** For implementation patterns, see [references/clarity-implementation.md](references/clarity-implementation.md)
```

4. Update verification checklist:
- [ ] All tests pass (`clarinet test` exits 0)
- [ ] No syntax errors (`clarinet check` passes)
- [ ] Best practices applied (sequential asserts, meaningful errors)
- [ ] Auto-fixes applied with explanations
  </action>
  <verify>
Phase 3 updated:
```bash
grep -A5 "Best Practices Review" skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md
grep "clarity-implementation.md" skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md
grep "clarinet check" skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md
```
  </verify>
  <done>
Phase 3 includes best practices review, auto-fix workflow, and link to clarity-implementation.md.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update Phase 4 (Verification) with coverage workflow</name>
  <files>skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Update Phase 4/5: Verification section in SKILL.md:

1. Fix the coverage command (CRITICAL - research says this is deprecated):
Change: `clarinet test --coverage`
To: `npm run test:coverage` (which runs `vitest run --coverage`)

2. Add coverage display after every test run:
```markdown
### Coverage Display

After every test run, I'll show coverage status:

```
Coverage: 87% (target: 90%)
├── Lines: 87%
├── Functions: 100%
├── Branches: 75%
└── Statements: 88%

Uncovered:
- transfer() line 45: zero-amount validation branch
- admin-set-fee() lines 67-70: entire function
```
```

3. Update coverage gap analysis:
```markdown
### Coverage Gap Analysis

When below 90%, I'll identify specific gaps and suggest tests:

"Line 45 is the zero-amount check in transfer().
Suggested test: 'should reject transfer with zero amount → ERR-INVALID-AMOUNT'"

Accept suggestions or provide your own test scenarios.
```

4. Add user override for 90% gate:
```markdown
### Coverage Gate Override

**Standard threshold:** 90%

If coverage is below 90% and you want to proceed anyway:
- Say "proceed anyway" or "skip coverage gate"
- I'll note the override and continue to Phase 5
- No justification required

**If TDD was skipped:** Threshold increases to 95%
```

5. Update verification checklist:
- [ ] Coverage >= 90% (or 95% if TDD skipped)
- [ ] All functions tested
- [ ] Uncovered lines identified with suggested tests
- [ ] Security review completed
  </action>
  <verify>
Phase 4 updated:
```bash
grep "npm run test:coverage" skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md || grep "vitest" skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md
grep "proceed anyway" skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md
grep "95%" skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md
grep -A10 "Coverage Display" skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md
```
  </verify>
  <done>
Phase 4 uses correct Vitest coverage command, displays coverage after every run, and includes override option.
  </done>
</task>
