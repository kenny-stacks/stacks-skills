## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Single `stacks-dev` skill covering full workflow.

### Plugin Foundation (3/3)

- [x] **PLUG-01**: Plugin has valid plugin.json with name, description, and skill references
- [x] **PLUG-02**: Plugin follows Claude Code plugin directory structure (skills/ at root, .claude-plugin/ for metadata only)
- [x] **PLUG-03**: Plugin loads via `--plugin-dir` flag for testing, installable via marketplaces for distribution

### Agent Skills Spec Compliance (8/8)

- [x] **SPEC-01**: Skill has `name` field (1-64 chars, lowercase + hyphens, matches directory name)
- [x] **SPEC-02**: Skill has `description` field (1-1024 chars, describes what skill does AND when to use it)
- [x] **SPEC-03**: Skill has `license` field specifying license terms
- [x] **SPEC-04**: Skill has `metadata` field with author and version
- [x] **SPEC-05**: Skill has `allowed-tools` field declaring required tools
- [x] **SPEC-06**: Skill passes `skills-ref validate` validation
- [x] **SPEC-07**: Skill follows progressive disclosure (~100 tokens metadata, <5k instructions)
- [x] **SPEC-08**: Skill uses optional directories correctly (references/, scripts/, assets/)

### Skill Structure (5/5)

- [x] **SKIL-01**: Single `stacks-dev` skill with valid SKILL.md and YAML frontmatter
- [x] **SKIL-02**: Skill description triggers auto-loading when user mentions Stacks, Clarity, or Clarinet
- [x] **SKIL-03**: Skill body stays under 500 lines (use supporting files for reference material)
- [x] **SKIL-04**: Skill uses progressive disclosure (reference files loaded on-demand)
- [x] **SKIL-05**: File references are one level deep (no nested reference chains)

### Design Phase (4/4)

- [x] **DSGN-01**: Skill guides user to write pseudo code before implementation
- [x] **DSGN-02**: Skill reviews designs against Clarity Book best practices (coding style, storage, upgradability)
- [x] **DSGN-03**: Skill recommends modular contract architecture for upgradability
- [x] **DSGN-04**: Skill references authoritative sources (Clarity Book, Stacks docs) not embedded docs

### TDD Workflow (4/4)

- [x] **TEST-01**: Skill enforces tests-first workflow (write tests before contract implementation)
- [x] **TEST-02**: Skill guides writing unit tests using Clarinet SDK
- [x] **TEST-03**: Skill validates test coverage using Clarinet coverage tools
- [x] **TEST-04**: Skill enforces 90%+ coverage gate before proceeding to frontend

### Contract Implementation (4/4)

- [x] **CONT-01**: Skill guides writing Clarity contracts following best practices
- [x] **CONT-02**: Skill applies coding style patterns (no unnecessary begin, meaningful errors, asserts over nested ifs)
- [x] **CONT-03**: Skill applies storage patterns (hash storage, minimize on-chain data)
- [x] **CONT-04**: Skill applies upgradability patterns (modular architecture, dynamic principals)

### Clarinet CLI (5/5)

- [x] **CLAR-01**: Skill guides project setup with `clarinet new` and `clarinet contracts new`
- [x] **CLAR-02**: Skill uses `clarinet check` for syntax and type validation
- [x] **CLAR-03**: Skill guides interactive testing with `clarinet console`
- [x] **CLAR-04**: Skill guides local development with `clarinet devnet start`
- [x] **CLAR-05**: Skill guides deployment with `clarinet deployments generate` and `clarinet deployments apply`

### Frontend Integration (4/4)

- [x] **FRNT-01**: Skill guides wallet integration using @stacks/connect
- [x] **FRNT-02**: Skill guides contract calls using @stacks/transactions
- [x] **FRNT-03**: Skill provides React/Next.js patterns for Stacks integration
- [x] **FRNT-04**: Skill guides network configuration using @stacks/network

### Quality & Verification (3/3)

- [x] **QUAL-01**: Skill includes verification steps so Claude can self-check work
- [x] **QUAL-02**: Skill declares required tools in frontmatter (allowed-tools)
- [x] **QUAL-03**: Skill provides clear phase transitions (design → tests → contract → coverage → frontend)
