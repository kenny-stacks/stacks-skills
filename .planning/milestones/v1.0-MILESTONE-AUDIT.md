## Gaps

**Critical Gaps:** None

**Non-Critical Gaps:** None

## Tech Debt

No tech debt accumulated. All phases completed cleanly.

## Observations (Informational Only)

1. **SKILL.md at 99% of line budget** (595/600 lines) - Monitor future additions
2. **Modular architecture pattern** in design reference could be more discoverable from SKILL.md (progressive disclosure working as designed)
3. **Phase 3 test dependency** is implicit rather than explicit (acceptable in TDD workflow context)

## Deliverables
