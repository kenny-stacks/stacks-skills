# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-29
**Phases:** 1-6
**Total Plans:** 13

## Overview

This roadmap delivered a Claude Code plugin for Stacks blockchain development with enforced TDD workflow. The approach follows research recommendations: start with a single comprehensive `stacks-dev` skill that handles the full development lifecycle, then refine based on actual usage patterns. The phases progress from foundation setup through core skill implementation to specialized workflow capabilities and frontend integration.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Plugin Foundation & Compliance

**Goal**: Create valid, installable plugin structure that passes all Agent Skills spec validations.
**Depends on**: None
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md - Create plugin structure, SKILL.md with frontmatter, optional directories
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md - Validate with skills-ref and test plugin loading

**Requirements:**
- PLUG-01: Plugin has valid plugin.json with name, description, and skill references
- PLUG-02: Plugin follows Claude Code plugin directory structure (skills/ at root, .claude-plugin/ for metadata only)
- PLUG-03: Plugin loads via `--plugin-dir` flag for testing, installable via marketplaces for distribution
- SPEC-01 through SPEC-08: Agent Skills spec compliance

**Details:**
- Created .claude-plugin/plugin.json with valid JSON structure
- Created skills/stacks-dev/SKILL.md with complete YAML frontmatter
- All skills-ref validation checks passed on first attempt

---

### Phase 2: Core Skill Structure

**Goal**: Implement the single comprehensive `stacks-dev` skill with progressive disclosure and workflow orchestration.
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (plugin foundation must exist)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md - Create reference files for progressive disclosure (clarity-design.md, clarity-tdd.md, clarity-cli.md, clarity-frontend.md)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md - Write SKILL.md workflow orchestration with 5 phases, gates, and verification steps
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md - Validate complete skill structure and test auto-invocation

**Requirements:**
- SKIL-01 through SKIL-05: Skill structure requirements
- QUAL-01 through QUAL-03: Quality and verification requirements

**Details:**
- Created 4 reference files (later expanded to 5 with clarity-implementation.md)
- SKILL.md grew to 431 lines with comprehensive workflow
- Progressive disclosure pattern established (load references on-demand)

---

### Phase 3: Design & Planning Phase

**Goal**: Enable contract design with pseudo code, logic flow, and best practices review.
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (core skill structure must exist)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md - Enhance clarity-design.md with design template, best practices checklist, and modular architecture

**Requirements:**
- DSGN-01 through DSGN-04: Design phase requirements

**Details:**
- Enhanced clarity-design.md with design template
- Added Clarity Book best practices integration
- Established modular architecture recommendations

---

### Phase 4: TDD Workflow & Contract Implementation

**Goal**: Enforce tests-first workflow with Clarinet SDK unit tests and contract implementation.
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (design phase outputs provide contract structure)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md - Enhance clarity-tdd.md with collaborative TDD workflow, Vitest patterns
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md - Create clarity-implementation.md with best practices patterns
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md - Update SKILL.md phases 2-4 with TDD enforcement and coverage workflow

**Requirements:**
- TEST-01 through TEST-04: TDD workflow requirements
- CONT-01 through CONT-04: Contract implementation requirements

**Details:**
- Collaborative test generation workflow (propose → approve → implement)
- Soft TDD enforcement with tracking display
- 90% coverage gate with user override option
- Best practices auto-fix for mechanical violations

---

### Phase 5: Clarinet CLI Integration

**Goal**: Guide project setup, validation, local development, and deployment using Clarinet CLI.
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (contracts and tests must exist to run CLI commands)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md - Enhance clarity-cli.md with CLI orchestration (command automation, error handling, devnet lifecycle, deployment safety)
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md - Update SKILL.md phases with CLI integration (project init, auto-validation, devnet workflow, deployment gates)

**Requirements:**
- CLAR-01 through CLAR-05: Clarinet CLI requirements

**Details:**
- Added command automation section
- Devnet lifecycle management
- Deployment safety with confirmation gates
- Console exploration documentation

---

### Phase 6: Frontend Integration

**Goal**: Connect deployed contracts to React/Next.js applications using Stacks.js libraries.
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (contracts must be deployed to devnet), Phase 4 (90%+ coverage gate must pass)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md - Update clarity-frontend.md with v8+ patterns and post-conditions
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md - Update SKILL.md Phase 5/5 with frontend workflow

**Requirements:**
- FRNT-01 through FRNT-04: Frontend integration requirements

**Details:**
- Updated to Stacks.js v8+ API patterns
- Added post-condition security section
- PostConditionMode.Deny requirement documented
- Final SKILL.md at 595 lines

---

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Single-skill MVP approach (avoid premature orchestration)
- Progressive disclosure from start (keep SKILL.md focused)
- Soft TDD enforcement (redirect, don't block)
- 90% coverage gate with user override
- Reference authoritative sources, don't embed docs
- v8+ @stacks/connect API (modern patterns only)

**Issues Resolved:**
- skills-ref is npm package, not pip (discovered during Phase 1)
- clarinet test --coverage deprecated, use npm run test:coverage (Vitest)
- SKILL.md line count managed through progressive disclosure

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None - all phases completed cleanly.
