# Project State: Stacks Skills Plugin

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-29
**Current Phase:** Phase 2 - Core Skill Structure (COMPLETE)
**Current Plan:** 02-03 completed, Phase 2 COMPLETE
**Status:** Phase 2 complete - Ready for Phase 3

## Project Reference

**Core Value:**
Enable developers to build high-quality Clarity smart contracts through enforced TDD workflow and comprehensive testing (unit + fuzz), with seamless frontend integration.

**Current Focus:**
Phase 2 complete. Core skill structure validated with skills-ref tool and human verification. Ready for Phase 3: Design Phase Guidance.

**Approach:**
Single-skill MVP - Build one comprehensive `stacks-dev` skill that handles the full workflow before considering multi-skill orchestration.

## Current Position

**Phase:** 2 of 6 (Core Skill Structure) - COMPLETE
**Plan:** 3 of 3 in phase (all complete)
**Status:** Phase complete
**Last activity:** 2026-01-29 - Completed 02-03-PLAN.md (Final Validation)

**Progress:** [████████████████░░░░] 80% (4/5 total plans in Phase 1-2)

### Phase 2 Goals - ACHIEVED

Implement the single comprehensive `stacks-dev` skill with progressive disclosure and workflow orchestration.

**Success Criteria:**
1. [x] Reference files exist for each workflow phase (clarity-design, clarity-tdd, clarity-cli, clarity-frontend)
2. [x] SKILL.md contains 5-phase workflow orchestration under 500 lines (431 lines)
3. [x] Each phase has explicit verification steps
4. [x] Phase transitions have gates (user confirmation or verification pass)
5. [x] Reference files are linked from appropriate phases in SKILL.md
6. [x] skills-ref validate passes (02-03 Task 1)
7. [x] Human verification confirms auto-invocation (02-03 Task 4)

**Requirements Coverage:** 8 requirements - ALL IMPLEMENTED AND VALIDATED
- FLOW-01, FLOW-02, FLOW-03, FLOW-04, FLOW-05
- PROG-01, PROG-02, PROG-03

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date | Phase-Plan |
|----------|-----------|------|------------|
| Single-skill MVP approach | Research strongly recommends avoiding premature orchestration; validate concept first | 2026-01-29 | Project Init |
| Standard depth (6 phases) | Balanced grouping for 39 requirements; natural workflow boundaries | 2026-01-29 | Project Init |
| Progressive disclosure from start | Keep skill under 500 lines; load references on-demand | 2026-01-29 | Project Init |
| Version 0.1.0 for initial development | Starting with semantic versioning 0.1.0 for initial development phase | 2026-01-29 | 01-01 |
| Apache-2.0 License | Open-source license for community contributions | 2026-01-29 | 01-01 |
| Full tool access in frontmatter | Granted all standard tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob) to support complete Stacks development workflow | 2026-01-29 | 01-01 |
| skills-ref installation via npm | skills-ref is an npm package (not Python pip); installed globally for validation | 2026-01-29 | 01-02 |
| Manual verification documentation | Documented manual testing steps in TESTING.md instead of full automation (requires interactive Claude Code session) | 2026-01-29 | 01-02 |
| One reference file per workflow phase | Aligns with progressive disclosure; load only relevant domain when entering phase | 2026-01-29 | 02-01 |
| Keep reference files under 200 lines | Supports Claude's partial loading; keeps content actionable | 2026-01-29 | 02-01 |
| Link to external docs not embed | Avoids duplication; stays current with authoritative sources | 2026-01-29 | 02-01 |
| 431 lines for SKILL.md | Comprehensive content while staying well under 500-line limit | 2026-01-29 | 02-02 |
| Auto-fix limit of 3 attempts | Aligns with research recommendation for verification loops | 2026-01-29 | 02-02 |
| TDD escape hatch with acknowledgment | Allows user override with explicit acknowledgment and increased thresholds | 2026-01-29 | 02-02 |
| Verification-only final plan | All artifacts created in 02-01 and 02-02; final plan validates completeness | 2026-01-29 | 02-03 |
| Human checkpoint for auto-invocation | Plugin loading behavior cannot be tested via automation | 2026-01-29 | 02-03 |

### Cross-Phase Context

**Research Insights:**
- CRITICAL: Start with single skill, only split if concrete limitations emerge
- Context window explosion is #1 pitfall - keep SKILL.md under 500 lines always
- Include verification steps in skill so Claude can self-check work
- Use `allowed-tools` frontmatter to pre-approve Bash, Read, Grep, Glob
- Reference authoritative sources (Clarity Book, Stacks docs) rather than embedding docs

**Architecture Notes:**
- Single `stacks-dev` skill handles: design -> test -> implement -> verify -> frontend
- Supporting files in references/ subdirectory for progressive disclosure
- Quality gate at Phase 4: 90%+ coverage required before frontend integration
- Reference files: clarity-design.md, clarity-tdd.md, clarity-cli.md, clarity-frontend.md
- SKILL.md uses Phase X/5 progress format with explicit gates

**Technology Stack:**
- Claude Code plugin system (Agent Skills spec + Claude extensions)
- Clarity smart contract language
- Clarinet development toolkit
- Rendezvous fuzz testing (deferred to v2)
- Stacks.js frontend libraries (React/Next.js)

- Research Clarinet SDK test patterns and APIs
- Understand coverage tool usage (`clarinet test --coverage`)

**Before Phase 6:**

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-01-29 20:05:00 UTC
**Stopped at:** Completed 02-03-PLAN.md (Phase 2 COMPLETE)
**Resume file:** None

**To Resume Work:**
1. Read this STATE.md for current position
2. Phase 2 is complete - begin Phase 3 planning
3. Review 03-CONTEXT.md if it exists, or gather context for Phase 3

**If Context is Lost:**
- Core context preserved in: PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md
- Research context in: research/SUMMARY.md, phases/02-core-skill-structure/02-RESEARCH.md
- All files in .planning/ directory

**Quick Status Check:**
```bash
cat .planning/STATE.md | grep "Current Phase"
cat .planning/ROADMAP.md | grep "Status"
```
