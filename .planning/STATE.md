# Project State: Stacks Skills Plugin

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-29
**Current Phase:** Phase 6 - Frontend Integration
**Current Plan:** 06-01 completed - Phase 6 IN PROGRESS
**Status:** Phase 6 in progress - clarity-frontend.md updated with v8+ patterns

## Project Reference

**Core Value:**
Enable developers to build high-quality Clarity smart contracts through enforced TDD workflow and comprehensive testing (unit + fuzz), with seamless frontend integration.

**Current Focus:**
Phase 6 in progress. clarity-frontend.md updated with @stacks/connect v8+ API patterns, post-conditions security section, transaction polling, and modern React patterns (06-01 complete). Reference file ready for SKILL.md integration.

**Approach:**
Single-skill MVP - Build one comprehensive `stacks-dev` skill that handles the full workflow before considering multi-skill orchestration.

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date | Phase-Plan |
|----------|-----------|------|------------|
| Single-skill MVP approach | Research strongly recommends avoiding premature orchestration; validate concept first | 2026-01-29 | Project Init |
| Standard depth (6 phases) | Balanced grouping for 39 requirements; natural workflow boundaries | 2026-01-29 | Project Init |
| Progressive disclosure from start | Keep skill under 500 lines; load references on-demand | 2026-01-29 | Project Init |
| Version 0.1.0 for initial development | Starting with semantic versioning 0.1.0 for initial development phase | 2026-01-29 | 01-01 |
| Apache-2.0 License | Open-source license for community contributions | 2026-01-29 | 01-01 |
| Full tool access in frontmatter | Granted all standard tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob) to support complete Stacks development workflow | 2026-01-29 | 01-01 |
| skills-ref installation via npm | skills-ref is an npm package (not Python pip); installed globally for validation | 2026-01-29 | 01-02 |
| Manual verification documentation | Documented manual testing steps in TESTING.md instead of full automation (requires interactive Claude Code session) | 2026-01-29 | 01-02 |
| One reference file per workflow phase | Aligns with progressive disclosure; load only relevant domain when entering phase | 2026-01-29 | 02-01 |
| Keep reference files under 200 lines | Supports Claude's partial loading; keeps content actionable | 2026-01-29 | 02-01 |
| Link to external docs not embed | Avoids duplication; stays current with authoritative sources | 2026-01-29 | 02-01 |
| 431 lines for SKILL.md | Comprehensive content while staying well under 500-line limit | 2026-01-29 | 02-02 |
| Auto-fix limit of 3 attempts | Aligns with research recommendation for verification loops | 2026-01-29 | 02-02 |
| TDD escape hatch with acknowledgment | Allows user override with explicit acknowledgment and increased thresholds | 2026-01-29 | 02-02 |
| Verification-only final plan | All artifacts created in 02-01 and 02-02; final plan validates completeness | 2026-01-29 | 02-03 |
| Human checkpoint for auto-invocation | Plugin loading behavior cannot be tested via automation | 2026-01-29 | 02-03 |
| Link to authoritative sources | Avoids content duplication, keeps references current with official docs | 2026-01-29 | 03-01 |
| Use vitest run --coverage | Clarinet SDK uses Vitest natively; clarinet test --coverage is deprecated | 2026-01-29 | 04-01 |
| Batch test writing after approval | Collaborative workflow: approve all scenarios first, then implement (not incremental) | 2026-01-29 | 04-01 |
| Soft TDD tracking format | Display "TDD: ✓ followed" or "TDD: ⚠ skipped" without blocking user | 2026-01-29 | 04-01 |
| Auto-fix mechanical changes only | Sequential asserts, unnecessary begin removal, unwrap-panic replacement auto-fixed; structural changes require user confirmation | 2026-01-29 | 04-02 |
| Implementation reference separate from design | clarity-implementation.md focuses on coding patterns; clarity-design.md focuses on architecture | 2026-01-29 | 04-02 |
| Collaborative test generation in SKILL.md Phase 2 | Propose scenarios → user reviews → approve → implement in batch (not incremental) | 2026-01-29 | 04-03 |
| TDD Status tracking across phases | Display [✓ followed \| ⚠ skipped] in Phase 2-4 headers for workflow transparency | 2026-01-29 | 04-03 |
| Coverage gate user override | Allow "proceed anyway" below 90% coverage with no justification required; 95% threshold when TDD skipped | 2026-01-29 | 04-03 |
| SKILL.md exceeds 500 lines (523) | Comprehensive Phase 4 content requires additional lines; trade-off accepted for complete guidance | 2026-01-29 | 04-03 |
| Concise CLI additions | Keep total CLI additions to ~60 lines to stay under 600-line limit (final: 583 lines) | 2026-01-29 | 05-02 |
| Devnet auto-deploy | No confirmation needed for devnet since it's local testing | 2026-01-29 | 05-02 |
| Console as exploration | Document console commands for manual testing, not automated workflows | 2026-01-29 | 05-02 |
| Removed all deprecated v7 API patterns | @stacks/connect v8+ has breaking changes; v7 patterns no longer work | 2026-01-29 | 06-01 |
| Added Post-Conditions as critical section | Unique Stacks security feature that protects users from malicious contracts | 2026-01-29 | 06-01 |
| File size limit of exactly 200 lines | Supports Claude's partial loading; keeps content actionable | 2026-01-29 | 06-01 |

### Cross-Phase Context

**Research Insights:**
- CRITICAL: Start with single skill, only split if concrete limitations emerge
- Context window explosion is #1 pitfall - keep SKILL.md under 500 lines always
- Include verification steps in skill so Claude can self-check work
- Use `allowed-tools` frontmatter to pre-approve Bash, Read, Grep, Glob
- Reference authoritative sources (Clarity Book, Stacks docs) rather than embedding docs

**Architecture Notes:**
- Single `stacks-dev` skill handles: design -> test -> implement -> verify -> frontend
- Supporting files in references/ subdirectory for progressive disclosure
- Quality gate at Phase 4: 90%+ coverage required before frontend integration
- Reference files: clarity-design.md, clarity-tdd.md, clarity-implementation.md, clarity-cli.md, clarity-frontend.md
- SKILL.md uses Phase X/5 progress format with explicit gates
- SKILL.md now at 595 lines with CLI + frontend integration (under 600-line limit)

**Technology Stack:**
- Claude Code plugin system (Agent Skills spec + Claude extensions)
- Clarity smart contract language
- Clarinet development toolkit
- Rendezvous fuzz testing (deferred to v2)
- Stacks.js frontend libraries (React/Next.js)
