# Stacks Skills

## What This Is

A Claude Code plugin for Stacks blockchain development. A single comprehensive `stacks-dev` skill guides developers through the entire development lifecycle using enforced TDD workflow: from contract design through testing, implementation, coverage verification, and React/Next.js frontend integration.

## Core Value

Enable developers to build high-quality Clarity smart contracts through enforced TDD workflow and 90%+ test coverage, with seamless frontend integration.

### Active

(None -- v1.0 complete, define new requirements for v2 with `/gsd:new-milestone`)

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app development -- web-first with React/Next.js only
- Vue/Svelte/other frameworks -- React/Next.js only, reduces scope
- Mainnet deployment automation -- safety concern, devnet/testnet focus
- Embedded reference docs -- link to authoritative sources, don't duplicate
- Multi-skill orchestration -- validated single skill handles use case well

## Context

### Current State (v1.0 shipped)

- **SKILL.md**: 595 lines with 5-phase TDD workflow
- **Reference files**: 5 files totaling ~1,150 lines
- **Tech stack**: Claude Code plugin, Clarinet, Stacks.js v8+
- **Quality**: 39/39 requirements validated, audit passed

### Key Technologies

**Clarity** -- Smart contract language for Stacks
**Clarinet** -- Development toolkit (project setup, testing, devnet, deployment)
**Stacks.js** -- Frontend libraries (@stacks/connect, @stacks/transactions, @stacks/network)

### Authoritative Sources

- **Stacks Docs**: https://docs.stacks.co/
- **Clarity Book**: https://book.clarity-lang.org/
- **Rendezvous Docs**: https://stacks-network.github.io/rendezvous/ (for v2 fuzz testing)

## Constraints

- **Skill Format**: Must follow Claude Code skill specification
- **Plugin Structure**: Shareable as installable plugin
- **Source of Truth**: Reference official docs, don't duplicate
- **Coverage Gate**: 90%+ required before frontend integration

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Single-skill MVP | Avoid premature orchestration; validate concept first | Good -- handles full workflow |
| Progressive disclosure | Keep SKILL.md focused; load references on-demand | Good -- 595 lines main, refs loaded as needed |
| Soft TDD enforcement | Redirect, don't block; respect user autonomy | Good -- maintains quality without frustration |
| 90% coverage gate with override | Enforce quality without being unreachable | Good -- balances rigor with flexibility |
| React/Next.js only | Most common Stacks frontend stack | Good -- clear scope, extensible later |
| v8+ @stacks/connect | Modern API patterns only | Good -- avoids deprecated patterns |
