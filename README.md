# Stacks Claude Code Plugin

A Claude Code plugin that provides an optimal experience developing Clarity smart contracts and full-stack apps on the Stacks blockchain through curated access to docs, testing workflows, and best practices.

*Plugin structure inspired by [wasp-lang/claude-plugins](https://github.com/wasp-lang/claude-plugins)*

> **Starting a new project?** Use [stacks-starter](https://github.com/kenny-stacks/stacks-starter) — a template with Clarinet, Vitest, and Next.js pre-configured.

## Features

- **Stacks Documentation**: Ensures Claude always accesses current Stacks documentation before writing Clarity code, avoiding outdated patterns from training data. Documentation index refreshes each session.
- **Adds Stacks Knowledge**: Import Stacks/Clarity best practices, conventions, and common pitfalls to your project's CLAUDE.md
- **Testing Support**: Run Clarinet SDK + Vitest tests with automatic error diagnosis and coverage reporting
- **Deployment Guidance**: Claude guides you through deploying contracts to testnet or mainnet with pre-flight checks and safety prompts
- **Development Environment**: Start Clarinet devnet and frontend dev servers with Chrome DevTools integration for full debugging visibility

## Installation

### Add the Stacks marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace add kenny-stacks/stacks-claude-plugin
```

### Install the Stacks plugin

```bash
/plugin install stacks@kenny-stacks-stacks-claude-plugin --scope project
```

> [!NOTE]
> We suggest installing the plugin at the `project` scope (`settings.json` are committed to git).
> Or by using the `local` scope (`settings.local.json` are not committed to git).

### Configure and Initialize the plugin

After installing, in an active session, run:
```bash
/stacks:init
```
- This will add Stacks knowledge to your project's CLAUDE.md file.

```
Run the 'start-dev-server' skill.
```
- This will start Clarinet devnet and your frontend dev server as background tasks so Claude can have full insight into both blockchain and frontend while developing/debugging.

Finally, to access more information about the plugin and its features, run:
```bash
/stacks:help
```
- This will show the plugin's features, commands, and skills.
